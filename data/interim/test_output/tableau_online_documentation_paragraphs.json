Change to Search behavior in Tableau Beginning with the 2022 Spring release, the Search functionality on the Search Results page in Tableau has changed. Prior to this release, content was indexed to allow “partial token matching.” This meant that you could search for a partial string. For example, if you searched for “super” the results could include content that contained the word “Superstore” in the title, description or columns, even if the word “super” was not present by itself."

        "text": "As of Spring 2022, indexing is done in a new way that supports both “full token matching” and “fuzzy token matching.” This means that the results you see will be based on complete strings, and will not do partial matches. Fuzzy matching provides partial matching on complete strings. To find \"Superstore\", you need to search for “superstore” or some variation of that entire string, for example “supertor”, “sperstore”, or “superstores”. Searching on just “super” will not return that match. The goal and benefit of this approach is to reduce noise, limiting the results to con- tent that more closely matches your search string. Recommendations for taking advantage of this change: l Use complete words in your query l Search for words that are present in the title or description of the content Quick Search"

Set permissions on a view Tip: While it’s possible to set view-level permissions within a workbook, we strongly recom- mend managing permissions at the project (or, if necessary, workbook) level. If a workbook is published with Show Sheets as Tabs checked, the views in that workbook will inherit all permissions set for the workbook. The permission dialog for a view will be read- only. In some situations, it may be valuable to specify permissions on a view independently from the workbook that contains it. If the workbook is published with Show Sheets as Tabs unchecked (sheet tabs hidden), the views will start with the workbook permissions but will be independent thereafter and can be set independently.

Manage Permissions with Projects Projects can simplify permission management with features such as nested projects, project visibility, non-admin project leaders, and locking permissions.

This method adds a new step when performing an incremental refresh. Tableau will first delete rows in the extract that are equal to the previous highest value seen. Tableau then queries for all rows that are higher than or equal to the previous highest value which will pick up all the deleted rows and any new ones.

For example: l You want regional salespeople to see sales figures only for their region. l You want sales managers to see statistics only for salespeople that report to them. l You want students to see visualizations based only on their own test scores. An approach to filtering data this way is called row-level security (RLS). There are multiple methods to accomplish row-level security both inside and outside of Tableau, each with its own pros and cons. Create a user filter and map users to values manually The simplest way to achieve row-level security in Tableau is through a user filter where you manually map users to values. For example, you could manually map a user named “Alice” to the value “East” so that she only sees rows in the data source where the “Region” column is “East”."

Create a dynamic user filter using a security field in the data Using this method, you create a calculated field that automates the process of mapping users to data values.

Unlike the above solutions for row-level security in Tableau, this method doesn't carry the same risk of exposing information if an author neglects to properly secure permissions on the workbook or data source, because the policy is enforced on the server for every query.

If your client is set up to run in Ser- vice mode, you don’t need to be logged on to the computer running the client, but your com- puter must be on. By default, the client runs as an Application. This means the Windows user must be logged on to the computer where the client is running for scheduled refreshes to com- plete. After sign-in, the Bridge client opens from the system tray. (Linux) Bridge on Linux runs in the background of Linux, which is the equivalent to Service mode in Tableau Bridge on Windows. See Application versus Service mode."

Base tables are the left-most tables in the data model. For guidance on how to determine which tables to use as base tables, see When to Use a Multi-fact Relationship Model. 1388\nTableau Software Tableau Cloud Help A multiple base table data model with one base table's tree highlighted.

Use the View Data Model option (Worksheet menu > View Data Model) to open a dialog with the data model you can refer to while on a sheet tab."

Terminology for dimensions and measures In Tableau, measures are aggregations—they’re aggregated up to the granularity set by the dimensions in the view. The value of a measure therefore depends on the context of the dimensions. For example, \"number of cereal boxes\" depends on if we mean the total invent- ory or the number of boxes per brand. Dimensions are usually categorical fields, such as country or brand. In Tableau, dimensions set the granularity, or the level of detail, of the view.

If an expected value summary says the mark is lower than expected or higher than expected, it means the aggregated mark value is outside the range of values that a statistical model is pre- dicting for the mark. If an expected value summary says the mark is slightly lower or slightly higher than expected or within the range of natural variation, it means the aggregated mark value is within the range of predicted mark values, but is lower or higher than the median. For more information, see What is an expected range? What are dimensions and measures?"

A data analyst reviewing an analysis of data about a recent marketing campaign in Tableau identifies a segment with lower engagement than the overall campaign audience. The data analyst knows this is an important subset of the overall data that the marketing team will want to address. So, the data analyst sends this low-engagement segment to Data Cloud. From Data Cloud, a member of the marketing team (or marketer) can access the segment to get a filtered view of the campaign data related to the low-engagement group. With a focused snippet of the overall data, it’s easier for the marketer to determine the actions they need to take to improve engagement.

In Tableau Pulse, you would create a metric defin- ition that includes the core value of the sum of daily sales with adjustable metric filters for region and product line. Then, you would create metrics for each region and product line. Fin- ally, you would add members of your organization as followers to the metrics that cover where and what they sell.

Members of your organization use that metric definition as a jumping off point to make metrics relevant to their needs, by slicing the data based on dif- ferent dimensions or time options. Because insights about these metrics are sent directly to fol- lowers, your colleagues get the data they need in their flow of work. With Tableau Pulse, users have an easy, self-service way to take part in guided data explor- ation. They can ask suggested questions to see how different dimensions affect the data. This Tableau Software\n1733 Tableau Cloud Help guided exploration complements the more free-form analysis that's possible with the tra- ditional Tableau viz authoring experience and allows users unfamiliar with Tableau analysis to understand their data."

You can implement this by using the Set Connection Info trans- formation in your migration plan.

If your workbook uses an extract, additional work is required. In this scenario, the workbook will be migrated and the live data connection updated.

The console runner only runs one migration plan (stored in a .edt file) at a time. If you have a group of migration plans you want to run as a group, then you can use a custom script in combination with the Content Migration Tool console runner. The example below is written in PowerShell and uses the console runner to execute a list of migration plans as a group. The following example code demonstrates: l Running multiple migration plans as a group using the console runner. l Optionally halting deployment of the group of plans immediately when any single migra- tion in the group fails. l Using the console runner’s exit code to determine whether the migration failed or logged warnings.
